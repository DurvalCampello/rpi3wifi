A Script to make your raspberry pi 3 into a AP(Acess Point)

This scrip is a junction of this(https://github.com/seanmragan/OnionPi/blob/master/pifi.sh) and this (https://gist.github.com/Lewiscowles1986/fecd4de0b45b2029c390) scripts. 

This script basically put together the best of theses two scripts above.
